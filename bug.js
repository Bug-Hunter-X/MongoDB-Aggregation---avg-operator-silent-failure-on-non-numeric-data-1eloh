```javascript
// Assuming you have a MongoDB collection named 'users'

db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { age: { $gt: 25 } }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$city",
      averageAge: { $avg: "$age" }
    }
  }
]);
```
This aggregation pipeline attempts to calculate the average age for users in each city.  However, if the `age` field in some documents is missing or contains non-numeric values, the `$avg` operator will return `null` for that city, potentially obscuring valid data in other cities. This isn't immediately obvious as an error, but leads to inaccurate results.
