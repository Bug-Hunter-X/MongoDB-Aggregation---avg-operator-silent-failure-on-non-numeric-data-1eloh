```javascript
// Solution: Add $match stage to filter out invalid age entries
db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      age: {
        $type: "number",
        $exists: true
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$city",
      averageAge: { $avg: "$age" }
    }
  }
]);
```
This solution adds a `$match` stage to the aggregation pipeline to filter out documents where the `age` field is not a number or does not exist. By filtering invalid data before performing the average calculation, the pipeline produces accurate results and avoids the silent failure of the `$avg` operator.
